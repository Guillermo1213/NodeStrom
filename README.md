# NodeStrom

Have you ever shopped online, and the moment you receive your items in the mail, it's total bunk becuase they don't look anything like they did on the website? Right, we're all on the same page, it's irritating! NodeStrom is your solution! Forget looking at reviews or pictures of the item you're about to buy, just to do it all through the comfort of your command line. Check out our products expertly described by our peeps, and know at that exact moment whether we have it in stock or not at that exact moment! 

## Usage
- Check out the item_id of the item you want to order
- Answer how many of this item you would like
- Look at your quantity and total to make sure we're not sold out, and you can actually afford what you're asking for! :D
